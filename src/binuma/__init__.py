"""A package to compute site frequency spectra (SFS) and the single-cell
mutational burden from genotype matrices from samples collected from either
healthy donors or cancer patients.


The single-cell mutational burden is the number of mutations found in one cell.
Both the SFS and the mutationa burden require mutational data obtained at
single-cell resolution.
This information is stored in genotype matrices.
Filled with 0s or 1s, a genotype matrix has rows/columns indicating mutations/cells
respectively."""
